# Design Tools for Rapid Prototyping 
## Figma and Design Assets
There are a number of advantages to be gained by effectively prototyping/wireframing in front-end software development. Prototyping your design and functionality can be a vital tool in ensuring that feedback is gathered early and often, which helps to build better products faster. Rapid prototyping allows for a visual to make sure all development/teams or other parties are all on the same page. Having the ability to catch problems, pain-points, points of interest, etc, before the development process takes place is important in ensuring a cost and time efficient development cycle.

The Rapid Prototyping Feedback Loop:
1. Build what you're testing
2. Test it on users, internal teams, or small focus groups 
3. Adjust design/functional elements to reflect feedback 
4. Repeat the process. 

One such tool for rapid prototyping is [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). Figma is a digital design and prototyping tool. It is a UI/UX design tool that can be used to create websites, apps, or smaller user interface components that can be integrated into other projects. Figma's collaborative cloud features make it a great tool for working with small and large teams, that require real-time input during the design and development process. Figma contains a few unique features that make prototyping really efficient: 
* Built in Commenting: Comments can be made on any design element or design space. Team members can be tagged, comments can be marked as resolved, and they can be integrated into third party business communication platforms like Slack. 
* Embedded CSS Styles: Figma components and design elements have auto-generated CSS properties, which aid in integrating figma designs into front-end projects extremely quick and easy. 
* Version Control: Version history ensures that updates can be made to designs without the fear of revising changes. It's similar to Github version control as older design sketches can be quickly reverted to or altered to fit design needs. 
* Cloud-based Collaboration: Small teams and large teams can easily collaborate on design elements in real time. Whether designs need to be approved by the end-user or internally, figma design files can be accessed online through the cloud or worked on from a desktop/workstation locally. 
* Components: Similar to other UI/UX tools, Figma allows for components to live at the heart of your designs. Easily exportable and editable, components ensure that the appropriate design elements are grouped together. The ability to edit certain elements at the individual level or components as a whole makes design changes quick and efficient. 
* Constraints: Components can be constrained to a particular predefined style or can be detached to allow full customization. The ability to copy components and design elements from other figma files and embed them in new projects puts re-usability at the forefront of design in Figma. 
* Libraries: You can share and update collections of components across projects. 
* Community Files and Figma Plugins: Figma has a wide variety of plugins, templates and other user-generated content available for use in it's Figma Community Hub. Similar to forking repositories in Github, you can easily incorporate other community members designs into your own projects.
