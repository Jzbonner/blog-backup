# Design Tools for Rapid Prototyping 
## Figma and Design Assets
There are a number of advantages to be gained by effectively prototyping/wireframing in front-end software development. Prototyping your design and functionality can be a vital tool in ensuring that feedback is gathered early and often, which helps to build better products faster. Rapid prototyping allows for a visual to make sure all development/teams or other parties are all on the same page. Having the ability to catch problems, pain-points, points of interest, etc, before the development process takes place is important in ensuring a cost and time efficient development cycle.

The Rapid Prototyping Feedback Loop:
1. Build what you're testing
2. Test it on users, internal teams, or small focus groups 
3. Adjust design/functional elements to reflect feedback 
4. Repeat the process. 

One such tool for rapid prototyping is [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). Figma is a digital design and prototyping tool. It is a UI/UX design tool that can be used to create websites, apps, or smaller user interface components that can be integrated into other projects. Figma's collaborative cloud features make it a great tool for working with small and large teams, that require real-time input during the design and development process. Figma contains a few unique features that make prototyping really efficient: 
* Built in Commenting: 
* Embedded CSS Styles: 
* Version Control:
* Cloud-based Collaboration: 
* Components: 
* Constraints: 
* Libraries: 
* Community Files and Figma Plugins:
